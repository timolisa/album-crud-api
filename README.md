- `albums[:i]` creates a new slice that contains all the existing elements up to the element to remove, and `albums[i+1:]` creates a new slice that contains all the existing elements up to the element that has to be removed.
- `...` is used to unpack elements of the slice i.e. expand elements of a collection (slice, array or iterable) into individual elements to a variadic parameter.


The `*` in `gin.Context` is used to denote a pointer type. A pointer in Go is a variable that holds the memory address of another value. It allows you to indirectly access and modify the value that it points to.

```
    func myHandler(c *gin.Context) {
    // Accessing the request and response using the context
    request := c.Request
    response := c.Writer

    // Modifying the context's data
    c.Set("key", "value")

    // Handling the request and generating a response
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"message": "Hello, World!"})
}

```

It represents a pointer to the `gin.Context` object. Pointers in Go are commonly used to avoid copying large objects when passing them between functions or modifying them within a function. Thus, by using a pointer you can modify the context and its underlying data, such as setting response headers, accessing request parameters or binding JSON data.
